MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database management system that is used for storing, retrieving, and managing data. It is classified as a document-oriented database, meaning it stores data in a format similar to JSON, called BSON (Binary JSON). MongoDB is commonly used in modern web and mobile applications due to its flexibility, scalability, and performance.
