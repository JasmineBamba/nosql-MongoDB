# nosql-MongoDB

MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database management system that is used for storing, retrieving, and managing data. It is classified as a document-oriented database, meaning it stores data in a format similar to JSON, called BSON (Binary JSON). MongoDB is commonly used in modern web and mobile applications due to its flexibility, scalability, and performance.While MongoDB offers many advantages, it has some drawbacks to consider.Complex queries, such as joins, can be challenging to perform compared to relational databases. In addition, MongoDB's flexible schema can lead to larger data sizes, duplicate data, increasing storage costs and network bandwidth usage.

## Project Overview

The project involves working with food establishment ratings data from the UK Food Standards Agency. The goal is to assist a food magazine company, "Eat Safe, Love," in making informed decisions about which food establishments to feature in their articles. The project can be divided into several key steps:

## Getting Started 

### Prerequisites

Before starting this project, basic understanding of the following concepts and tools is required:

* Python Programming: Should be comfortable with Python programming, as we'll be using Python to interact with the MongoDB database and perform data analysis.

* Jupyter Notebooks: Familiarity with Jupyter Notebooks is essential, as we'll be working with Jupyter Notebook files to write and execute your code.

* MongoDB Basics: A basic understanding of MongoDB and NoSQL databases is helpful. Must know how to create databases, collections, insert documents, and perform queries in MongoDB.

* Git and GitHub: Should be comfortable using Git for version control and have a GitHub account to store and manage project files.

### Installation

To set up the project environment, we will need to install the following tools and libraries:

* MongoDB: Install MongoDB on local machine or use a cloud-based MongoDB service. Follow the installation instructions for your specific operating system from the official MongoDB website (https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community).

* Python: If you don't already have Python installed, download and install the latest version of Python from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/downloads/).

* Jupyter Notebook: Install Jupyter Notebook using pip, the Python package manager. Can be done by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

Copy code
`pip install notebook`
PyMongo: PyMongo is a Python driver for MongoDB. Install it using pip:

Copy code
pip install pymongo
Pandas: Pandas is a powerful data manipulation library in Python. You can install it using pip:

Copy code
pip install pandas
NumPy: NumPy is a library for numerical computations in Python. Install it using pip:

Copy code
pip install numpy
Git: If Git is not already installed on your machine, you can download and install it from the official Git website.
