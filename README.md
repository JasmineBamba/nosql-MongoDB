# nosql-MongoDB

MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database management system that is used for storing, retrieving, and managing data. It is classified as a document-oriented database, meaning it stores data in a format similar to JSON, called BSON (Binary JSON). MongoDB is commonly used in modern web and mobile applications due to its flexibility, scalability, and performance.While MongoDB offers many advantages, it has some drawbacks to consider.Complex queries, such as joins, can be challenging to perform compared to relational databases. In addition, MongoDB's flexible schema can lead to larger data sizes, duplicate data, increasing storage costs and network bandwidth usage.
